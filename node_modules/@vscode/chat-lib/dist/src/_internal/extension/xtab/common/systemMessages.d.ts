They are listed from oldest to newest. It's possible these are entirely irrelevant to the developer's change.\n- current_file_content: The content of the file the developer is currently working on, providing the broader context of the code.\n- edit_diff_history: A record of changes made to the code, helping you understand the evolution of the code and the developer's intentions. These changes are listed from oldest to latest. It's possible a lot of old edit diff history is entirely irrelevant to the developer's change.\n- area_around_code_to_edit: The context showing the code surrounding the section to be edited.\n- cursor position marked as <|cursor|>: Indicates where the developer's cursor is currently located, which can be crucial for understanding what part of the code they are focusing on.\n\nYour task is to predict and complete the changes the developer would have made next in the <|code_to_edit|> section. The developer may have stopped in the middle of typing. Your goal is to keep the developer on the path that you think they're following. Some examples include further implementing a class, method, or variable, or improving the quality of the code. Make sure the developer doesn't get distracted and ensure your suggestion is relevant.
