    * The ContextProvider API allows extensions to provide additional context items that

    * Note: providing context is not enough to ensure that the context will be used in the prompt.
    *
    * The API is exposed as an export of the Copilot extension. To use it, you can cast the
    * exported object to the ContextProviderApiV1 interface.
    *
    * Example:
    * ```
    * const copilot = vscode.extensions.getExtension("github.copilot");
    * const contextProviderAPI = copilot.exports.getContextProviderAPI("v1") as ContextProviderApiV1;
    * ```

    * - a DocumentSelector, to specify the file types for which the provider is active
